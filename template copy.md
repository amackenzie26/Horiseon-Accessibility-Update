# Project Title

In this project, I was assigned to take existing HTML and CSS code and make it more a website for Horiseon Digital Marketing more accessible to impaired users. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have access to a screen reader, Google Chrome, VS Code, and Github to review all assetts of this application. 


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be:

From the Github repository located at https://github.com/amackenzie26/Horiseon-Accessibility-Update

Open the URL: https://amackenzie26.github.io/Horiseon-Accessibility-Update/


Run a screen reading test to make sure it is accessible to hearing impaired users.

Inspect the web page and use Lighthouse to check for accessibility compliance.
