# Code Refactor Horiseon Digital Marketing

In this project, I was assigned to take existing HTML and CSS code from an existing website for Horiseon Digital Marketing and make it more accessible to users. I was also assigned to improve the semantics of the HTML and CSS documents. 

Here is a screenshot of the entire completed webpage:
